## Installation
Ideas are immortal and can be installed to the minds of humanity. Forever. 
This is a response to the service design challenge related to Hacklab Mikkeli.

## Initial plan
- Create a customer journey for Hacklab 
- Enrich and utilise premade archetypes
- Define and design touchpoints for the journey
- Increase attractiveness, conspicuousness, and commitment 
- Root the solution candidate to design thinking, hacker ethics, and the local hacklab scene

## Planned outcomes
- Actionable plan
- Customer journey with touchpoints and some kind of blueprintish plan
- Rich description
- Touch of overengineering, technical kickailu (as in kikkailu), and hacker ethics (note the fabulous use of the Oxford comma)

## Achievements
Work was done utilising crowdsourced approach and double diamond service design workshops.

Crowsourced materials: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmnUtnQ=/

We designed three customer journeys for Hacklab Mikkeli
1. visit (attract people to visit the community and Hacklab)
2. inspire (inspire action and sense of community)
3. engage & commit (engage people and community, try to increase commitment and belonging)

OKR framework was kind of utilised as guideline in a non-restrictive manner. 

Based on each journey and their objecives concepts were brainstormed. From the materials one concept was chosen to be further developed. 

WizKid Kolmiottelu is the primary outcome. However, the materials provide solid and data-based ground to develop new concepts rooted in our mission and objectives.
